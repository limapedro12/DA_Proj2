## DA: Programming Project II 
<p >This is a possible solution for the second programming project of the DA (Desenho de Algoritmos) course, which belongs to the 2nd year of the Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática e Computação, taught by Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto (FEUP) and Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto (FCUP).</p>
<p >This work was developed by João Francisco da Rocha Sequeira Alves (202006281), Pedro de Almeida Lima (202108806) and Pedro Simão Januário Vieira (202108768).</p>
<p >For the purpose of representing the graphs contained in the given dataset, we reused and adapted the <a class="el" href="class_graph.html" title="A class that represents a graph.">Graph</a> implementation used in classes.</p>
<p >We developed a user interface consisting of a menu with 4 submenus, each one covering one set of tasks as described in the project handout. The UI is entirely text-based. </p>
