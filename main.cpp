/**
 * @mainpage DA: Programming Project II
 *
 * This is a possible solution for the second programming project of the DA (Desenho de Algoritmos) course, which belongs
 * to the 2nd year of the Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática e Computação, taught by Faculdade de Engenharia da
 * Universidade do Porto (FEUP) and Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto (FCUP).
 *
 * This work was developed by João Francisco da Rocha Sequeira Alves (202006281), Pedro de Almeida Lima (202108806)
 * and Pedro Simão Januário Vieira (202108768).
 *
 * For the purpose of representing the graphs contained in the given dataset, we reused and adapted
 * the Graph implementation used in classes.
 *
 * We developed a user interface consisting of a menu with 4 submenus, each one covering one set of tasks as described
 * in the project handout. The UI is entirely text-based.
